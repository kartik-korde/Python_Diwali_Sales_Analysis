# Python_Diwali_Sales_Project

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Diwali sales data. Key tasks and findings include:

Data Cleaning and Manipulation: Cleaned and organized the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Leveraged Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries to visualize and analyze the data.
Customer Insights: Identified potential customers across different states, occupations, gender, and age groups, contributing to enhanced customer experiences.
Product and Inventory Analysis: Analyzed the most selling product categories and individual products, providing valuable insights to plan inventory and meet market demand efficiently.
This project helped generate actionable insights to optimize business strategies and improve operational efficiency during the Diwali sales period.
